# simplex

# Rules

1) You may only move forward, straight or diagonally
2) You may jump only one piece at a time, and it must be your opponent's piece
3) If your piece is jumped you must place the piece back on your start row, if you are unable to do so then you must make a move that will allow you to on the following turn
4) Your goal is to get all of your pieces to your opponent's starting row

# Current implementations

python

# Planned implementations

C

Rust

# Current state

Unplayable, unfortunately the python implementation has some critical errors that need to be fixed. The two most glaring are the inability to place pieces, and the false jumps that occur. This repository will remain open, but it is ill advised to play the game digitally. If you wish to play simplex, the python version will give you a correct initial board state.

# Additional notes

if you create another implementaion add it to this repository
